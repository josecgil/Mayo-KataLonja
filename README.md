This codekata was designed by Agilismo.es to be used at XGN 2011, in Santiago de Compostela (Galicia, Spain), hence is based on a metaphor related to the fish, but actually hides another problem.

In the auction of a Galician fishing port, a Galician entrepreneur has decided to market fresh Galician fish in other cities of Europe, for it will start with a small van which is **can carry up to 200 kg of fish** .

For the first trip has purchased **50 kg of clams, 100 kg of octopus and other 50 kg of crabs**, but he wonders where he should sell this load for maximum benefit.

These are the selling prices in various local markets:

| €/kg    | Madrid | Barcelona | Lisboa |
|---------|--------|-----------|--------|
| Clams   | 500    | 450       | 600    |
| Octopus | 0      | 120       | 100    |
| Crabs   | 450    | 0         | 500    |

But we must also bear in mind that **loading the van will cost 5€ plus 2€ per km driven**.

The distances to possible destinations are:

* To MADRID : 800 Km
* To BARCELONA : 1100 Km
* To LISBOA : 600 Km


And finally, keep in mind that buyers estimate that the **purchase value of the load depreciates by 1% for every 100 kilometers traveled**.

Remember, **The aim is to meet our entrepreneurial friend where he should sell seafood to get the most benefit**.

This data is only an example for one day, you must solve the problem for every possible combination of product, city and price  given by our enterpreneur.
